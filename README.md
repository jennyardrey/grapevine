This app is an MVP for Grapevine, a tool for team leaders and employers to communicate more effectivly with their team/employees.

There are future plans to develop this app fully.

Grapevine was created by Jenny Ardrey and Gareth Beer as part of the ManchesterCodes Software Engineer FastTrack course. You can find out more information about this here: https://www.manchestercodes.com/software-engineer-fasttrack
